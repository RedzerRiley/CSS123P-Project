The cat sat on the mat.
I love to code games.
The sun is bright today.
Birds fly in the sky.
Fish swim in the water.
Books are fun to read.
Cars drive on roads.
Trees grow very tall.
Pizza tastes really good
Music makes me happy.
Rain helps plants grow.
Snow is cold and white.
Fire is hot and bright.
Ice cream is very sweet.
